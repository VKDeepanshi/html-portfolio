    <h1>
        About me :-
    </h1>
    <p>
        I am outgoing, dedicated, and open-minded. I get across to people and adjust to changes with ease. <br>
         I believe that a person should work on developing their professional skills and learning new things all the time. <br>
          Currently, I am looking for new career opportunities my current job position cannot provide. <br>
          I have enough experience to occupy a managing position and I will be glad <br>
          to work on increasing the customer loyalty rate of your company. <br>
    </p>
